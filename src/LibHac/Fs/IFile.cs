    /// or write as many bytes as it can and return that number of bytes to the caller.

    /// - If <see cref="Write"/> is called on an offset past the end of the <see cref="IFile"/>,
    /// the <see cref="OpenMode.AllowAppend"/> mode is set and the file supports expansion,
    /// the file will be expanded so that it is large enough to contain the written data.</remarks>
